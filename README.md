Booking.com: A Hospitality Giant Facing Modern Challenges
Part 1: Identifying and Justifying the Challenge (400 Words)
The digital transformation of the hospitality industry has significantly shaped consumer expectations, operational efficiency, and global competition. Booking.com, as one of the world’s leading online travel agencies (OTAs), has long dominated the accommodation booking space. However, a pressing challenge it currently faces is platform trust and service transparency, both for users and service providers.
From a global context, Booking.com operates in over 220 countries and territories, facing diverse regulatory environments, cultural expectations, and service standards. In 2020, the European Commission launched an investigation into OTAs, including Booking.com, for misleading discount practices and unclear pricing mechanisms (European Commission, 2020). These allegations have impacted consumer trust, especially among price-sensitive travelers post-COVID-19.
In a local context, consider the United Kingdom. Following Brexit, new regulations have required online platforms to increase compliance transparency for listings and customer reviews. Many small, local hotels have reported algorithmic bias where their listings receive lower visibility due to lack of participation in Booking.com's commission-based programs (Smith et al., 2022). This affects fair competition and local economies that rely on tourism.
The global-local relationship intensifies these issues. Booking.com’s centralised platform must comply with varying regional standards while maintaining uniformity in user experience. For example, price transparency requirements in the EU may not be applicable in the US or Asia, resulting in different levels of perceived reliability across countries. Furthermore, cultural expectations around hospitality—such as personalized service or direct customer engagement—can’t always be replicated through an algorithmic interface, leading to dissatisfaction among users in more relational cultures (Hjalager, 2019).
This challenge is not just a technological issue but a socio-economic one, intertwining global regulation, local tourism economies, and the digital labor market of hospitality service providers. To maintain its dominance, Booking.com must address trust and transparency through context-sensitive design and mobile communication strategies.

Part 2: Proposing Solutions via Mobile Website Content (600 Words)
Booking.com’s platform trust issues must be resolved through technological transparency, localized UX (user experience), and mobile-friendly informational support. Below are three solutions backed by peer-reviewed academic research and industry reports.
1. Localized Algorithmic Transparency Dashboards
One of the most effective solutions lies in enhancing algorithmic transparency through interactive dashboards tailored by region. Research by Cobbe et al. (2021) emphasizes that platforms benefit from making algorithmic logic partially visible to users, which increases trust without compromising proprietary secrets. A mobile-friendly feature could allow users and providers to understand how visibility rankings are determined — e.g., user ratings, response time, commission level.
Critically reviewing this model in different contexts shows its scalability. In the EU, legal pressure under the Digital Services Act encourages platform transparency. In Indonesia, where OTA usage is high but digital literacy lower, such dashboards need simplified explanations and iconography (Wijaya et al., 2022). Hence, mobile optimization should adapt content readability by region.
2. In-App Review Verifiability Features
Studies have shown that customer reviews are central to consumer decision-making, but are often gamed or manipulated (Xie et al., 2017). A mobile website solution could incorporate a verified stay badge, cross-referenced with booking confirmation, ensuring only real guests can leave feedback. Implementing a “trust meter” with visual cues (e.g., green check for verified, grey for unverified) allows consumers to assess authenticity quickly.
In North America, where consumers are tech-savvy and expect real-time feedback, this system aligns with expectations. In Eastern Europe, however, public trust in digital platforms is lower due to misinformation issues (Ivanov et al., 2021), so additional pop-up explanations or educational modals could be useful.
3. Culturally-Tailored Chatbot Support with Embedded Video Tutorials
An essential mobile feature would be a multilingual chatbot that delivers video explanations about booking policies, refund conditions, and loyalty programs. Kuo et al. (2019) found that culturally-adaptive chatbots significantly reduce user frustration and increase booking conversion rates. This bot could deliver content like short video clips embedded in mobile pages, reducing dependence on text for users with limited literacy or language proficiency.
For instance, in Japan, where etiquette is critical, a chatbot could explain cancellation policies with attention to polite tone. In Brazil, where customer service is expected to be warm and personalized, a video-hosted virtual concierge might appeal more.
